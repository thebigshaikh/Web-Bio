I am a graduate student pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from San Diego State University.
  I have worked as a Data Scientist for over 3 Years before continuing with my grad studies.
  I interned at Amazon Seattle over Summer of 2022 as a Software Development Engineer.
  I love to hike! You can find few of my hiking pictures in the gallery!
  I am a die-hard Manchester United supporter! GGMU!
