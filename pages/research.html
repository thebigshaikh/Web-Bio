    Put forward a data storage infrastructure built on top of multi-node Hadoop cluster to store healthcare data which included Electronic Health Records of people. This data storage is designed and configured in such a way that it could handle data of any type and formats. Media data such as images and videos could be stored on this cluster as well.
    The data storage solution aimed at overcoming the costs associated with storing such humongous size of data by using commodity hardware to store them. By using paradigms of distributed and parallel computing, the data had a fast access time with very low transfer latency.
    Apart from storage, this data was also utilized for developing machine learning models to understand medical patterns amongst the people. For instance, all chest scans were used to train a neural network in order to detect tuberculosis. GoogleLeNet was used which provided a respectable 83% accuracy.

    <p>
        The paper describes the advantages of merging AR and big data to invent new interesting applications is starting to have a tangible presence. The main aim is to uncover the problems and ease the issues in visualization of Big Data and at the same time the objective of finding valid solutions for the problems in Big Data Visualization remains. We reveal disadvantages of currently existing visualization methods based on the results. Based on the results, a not so common approach is proposed: the capabilities and methods of virtual and augmented reality could be implemented to achieve Visualization of the big data.

        In this project, I explored how distributed computing can be utilized to store big data on commodity hardware. This paper discussed about Apache Hadoop, HDFS, Pig and Hive. More importantly, it helps understand how Map Reduce algorithm is used to process large volume of data distributed across different systems in a multi-node network.     </p>

    <p>
        This paper discusses various machine learning model which are used for developing intelligent systems. Supervised, Semi-supervised and Unsupervised algorithms were explored in depth in order to understand their use cases and applications. Additionally, how to evaluate the performances of this algorithms was done as well.    </p>
